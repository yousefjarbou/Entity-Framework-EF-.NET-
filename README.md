## Entity-Framework (EF .NET)
## Entity Framework Demo

This project demonstrates the core concepts of **Entity Framework Core**, including:

- **Creating and managing database tables**
- **Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
- **Applying database migrations**

## Why This Project?

As part of my **internship**, I encountered a task that required knowledge of **Entity Framework Core**, a technology I had never used before. Instead of shying away, I took the challenge head-on, quickly learning **EF Core** and applying it effectively. 

This project is a **practical demonstration** of how I can **adapt to new technologies** and learn whatever is needed to accomplish a task.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET 8**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQL Server**
